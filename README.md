## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install development dependencies
3. Make your changes in the `cc/src/` directory
4. Run `node build.js` to build the addon in `chrome` and `firefox` folders
5. If changing the interactive demo for the website, `node build.sh` will also update the `web/addon` folder.

### Development Guidelines

1. **Code Style**: Code is automatically formatted with Prettier on commit
2. **Commit Messages**: Use conventional commits format:
   - `feat: add new feature`
   - `fix: resolve bug`
   - `docs: update documentation`
   - See [commit guidelines](.husky/commit-msg) for all types
3. **Cross-browser compatibility**: Test on both Chrome and Firefox
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant docs in the `docs/` folder
5. **Website**: Make sure the website interactive demo still functions appropriately. The easiest way is to serve the `web` folder by using something like: `python -m http.server 8000` inside the `web` dir.

### Available Commands

```bash
npm run format        # Format all files
npm run format:check  # Check formatting without changing files
node build.js         # Build extension for all browsers
```
